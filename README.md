# DeltaCube SMP

![Screenshot](Server%20logo1.png)

Welcome to our information page for DeltaCube SMP! To recap, we are a vanilla survival multiplayer server running a lightweight version of Spigot (PaperSpigot). Although we do have some plugins and datapacks, we'd still like to consider ourselves to be leaning heavily on the vanilla side of Minecraft. Just a heads up - be prepared to find fast ways to travel through the server, as /tp is not a thing on our server.

* **Server Version:** 1.13.2
* **Platform:** PaperSpigot
* **Plugins:** HorseStats, LWC, CoreProtect, Essentials, PlayerHeads, ColoredSigns
* **Datapacks:** 12 Trapdoors, 4 Bark Blocks, AFK Display, Anti Ghast Grief, Back to Blocks, Double Shulker Shells, Double Slab Crafting, Dragon Drops Elytra, Giant Phantoms, More Stairs Crafting, Multiplayer Sleep, Shulkermites, Track Raw Statistics, Tridents o' Plenty, Uncraftable Nether Wart Block, Universal Dyeing

We take pride in the work our community puts into each and every world we play on. Therefore, do not expect map wipes to happen frequently. Map wipes occur only when a new and game-altering major release of Minecraft is available, or when a consensus is reached amongst the community that the map has reached a point where "everything has been done."
